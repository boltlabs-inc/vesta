# Parsing Vesta's `case!` macro

This crate defines parsing and compilation for the [Vesta](https://crates.io/crates/vesta) crates's
`case!` macro. If you need to parse a macro invocation that matches this syntax and/or emit code
from a macro that matches its output, depend on this crate. Otherwise, you likely want to depend on
`vesta` itself.
